"""
Manual verification script for scheduling.multi_absence_planner.
MultiAbsenceCoordinator.

Run:
    python3 test_multi_absence_planner.py

This matches this repository's existing test_*.py convention
(runnable, print-based verification scripts against the REAL
loaded timetable data, e.g. test_faculty_fixes.py) rather than a
pytest suite - there is no existing pytest-style coverage for
scheduling/ to stay consistent with. Every scenario below prints
an explicit PASS/FAIL line, and the process exits with a non-zero
status if anything fails, so it can still be used as a pass/fail
gate.

DATA SAFETY
-----------
Every scenario that needs to CONFIRM an assignment, or needs to
simulate an assignment already being confirmed, uses a throwaway
FacultyAssignmentEngine backed by a temporary AssignmentStore
file inside a tempfile.mkdtemp() directory - never the real
data/assignments.json.

Scenario 12 is the only one that touches the real store, and it
only ever calls plan() (read-only) against it - never confirm().
The scenario explicitly hashes data/assignments.json before and
after to prove it is byte-for-byte unchanged.

No faculty name, class name, subject, or slot used below is
invented - every one was discovered by inspecting the actual
loaded timetable data before writing this script (see the
Phase 2 write-up for how each was found).
