EXAM DUTY MANAGEMENT

Helps identify, rank, and confirm faculty invigilators for an
exam session, and reports on already-confirmed exam duties.

This module does not implement its own faculty-lookup, free/busy,
or persistence primitives from scratch. It is a thin coordination
layer on top of the EXISTING engines:

    QueryEngine
        faculty_free_for_period()/faculty_status_for_period() -
        the existing clock-time/weekday free-busy logic already
        used throughout the project - reused here unchanged so a
        faculty member's regular-timetable availability is
        determined identically everywhere in the app.

    FacultyWorkloadEngine
        exam_duty_candidates() - the existing read-only candidate
        ranking (free faculty for a day/time range, ordered by
        regular teaching workload). Reused unchanged; this module
        only ADDS an exam-duty-specific fairness tiebreak and
        exam-duty-specific conflict filtering on top of it - it
        never reimplements the free/busy or workload logic.

    ExamDutyStore
        The smallest new persistence overlay: a JSON-file-backed
        list of CONFIRMED exam-duty records. Canonical timetable
        events, AssignmentStore, and RoomShiftStore are never
        touched by this module.

Nothing here hard-codes any faculty name, date, time, hall, or
duty count/limit. Every decision is derived from whatever the
query/workload engines report for the timetable data currently
loaded, plus whatever exam-duty records have actually been
confirmed.

============================================================
DATE-AWARE DESIGN
============================================================

Regular timetable data uses a recurring weekday/slot concept,
which cannot distinguish different exam weeks. An exam duty is
therefore always identified by a REAL CALENDAR DATE (exam_date,
expected as an ISO "YYYY-MM-DD" string) plus a clock start/end
time. The weekday used to check regular-timetable availability is
always DERIVED from that date (via Python's own calendar/date
handling) - it is never accepted or hard-coded separately, so it
can never disagree with the actual date.

============================================================
CONFLICTS
============================================================

A candidate is excluded from a proposal/confirmation when EITHER:

    - the regular timetable reports them busy for the derived
      weekday/time range (via FacultyWorkloadEngine.
      exam_duty_candidates(), which itself is powered by
      QueryEngine.faculty_free_for_period()), or

    - ExamDutyStore reports an already-CONFIRMED exam duty for
      that exact person overlapping the same date/time range.

A faculty member can be free from the regular timetable but still
unavailable because of an already-confirmed exam duty - both
checks are always applied together.

============================================================
FAIRNESS
============================================================

FacultyWorkloadEngine.exam_duty_candidates() already ranks
candidates by regular teaching workload (fewer daily periods =
better candidate). That ranking is preserved as the PRIMARY sort
key. This module extends it with the candidate's own accumulated
CONFIRMED exam-duty count (from ExamDutyStore) as a secondary
tiebreak - among otherwise similarly-loaded candidates, the one
with fewer existing confirmed exam duties is preferred. No
fairness threshold or faculty limit is hard-coded anywhere; the
scoring is a simple, deterministic sort.

============================================================
PLAN / CONFIRM
============================================================

plan_duty() is completely side-effect free: it never writes to
ExamDutyStore. confirm_duty() re-resolves candidate availability
FROM SCRATCH (rather than trusting the plan's earlier snapshot),
so any change to the timetable or exam-duty state between planning
and confirming - including a stale/no-longer-valid plan - is
caught rather than silently applied. Confirmation is the ONLY
operation that persists an exam-duty record.
